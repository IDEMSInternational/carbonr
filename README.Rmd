## Overview

carbonr is a package in R to conveniently calculate carbon-equivalent emissions:

* `airplane_emissions()`
* `ferry_emissions()`
* `hotel_emissions()`
* `office_emissions()`
* `rail_emissions()`
* `raw_fuels()`
* `vehicle_emissions()`

These all return carbon-equivalent emissions in tonnes. The emissions values in the calculations are from the UK Government report (2021).

A shiny app is also available by `shiny_emissions()` to calculate carbon-equivalent emissions with a GUI.
 
## Installation

You can install the development version of carbonr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IDEMSInternational/carbonr")
```


## Usage

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(carbonr)

# To calculate emissions for a flight between Vancouver and Toronto
airport_finder(name = "Vancouver")
airport_finder(name = "Toronto")
airplane_emissions("YVR", "YYZ")

# To calculate emissions for a round trip ferry from Melbourne to New York
seaport_finder(country = "Australia", city = "Melbourne")
seaport_finder(country = "US", city = "New York")
ferry_emissions("POR", "BOY", round_trip = TRUE)

# To calculate emissions for a train journey from Bristol Temple Meads to Edinburgh Waverley, via Birmingham New Street.
rail_finder(station = "Bristol")
rail_finder(station = "Edinburgh")
rail_finder(station = "Birmingham")
rail_emissions(from = "Bristol Temple Meads", to = "Edinburgh", via = "Birmingham New Street")

# To calculate vehicle emissions for a 100 mile bus journey
land_emissions(distance = 100, units = "miles", vehicle = "Bus")

# Additional emissions can be calculated as well. For example, office emissions
office_emissions(specify = TRUE, electricity_kWh = 2455.2, water_supply = 85, heat_kWh = 8764)

# Alternatively, more advance emissions can be given with the `raw_fuels()` function.
```

## Shiny App

An interactive calculator using Shiny can be accessed by the `shiny_emissions()` function. This calculator uses the functions in the `carbonr` package: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
shiny_emissions()
```

Note emissions for flights in the code uses values from direct effects only. Radiative forcing = TRUE will give indirect and direct effects. (multiplys by 1.891).
