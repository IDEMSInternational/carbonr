 An R package to conveniently calculate carbon-equivalent emissions.
 
## Installation

You can install the development version of carbonr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IDEMSInternational/carbonr")

```

## Example

```{r example}
library(carbonr)
# Want to calculate emissions for a flight between Vancouver and Toronto

airport_finder(name = "Vancouver")
airport_finder(name = "Toronto")
airplane_emissions("YVR","YYZ")

```

### Emissions calculated
                                                                                             
The emissions values used in the calculations are from the UK Government report (2021).

* airplane emissions
* ferry emissions
* hotel stay emissions
* office emissions
* rail emissions
* raw fuel emission data (primary source)
* vehicle emissions

Note emissions for flights in the code uses values from direct effects only. Radiative forcing = TRUE will give indirect and direct effects. (multiples by 1.891).
See "business travel - air" sheet of gov.uk excel sheet linked above.
