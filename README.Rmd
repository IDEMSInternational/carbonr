## Overview

carbonr is a package in R to conveniently calculate carbon-equivalent emissions. The emissions values in the calculations are from the [UK Government report (2022)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2022) whereever available. For more specific functions related to operating theatre waste, alternative sources are used given in the References section.
Carbon credit prices are additionally available in the `carbon_credit_price` function where values are based on the [World Bank data](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/). The jurisdiction and year available for that jurisdiction can be found in the `check_CPI()` function.

## Installation

You can install the development version of carbonr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IDEMSInternational/carbonr")
```

## Aims of carbonR
In 2021, work began on the carbonr package in R with the aim of addressing the following challenges and improving the estimation of carbon-equivalent emissions. This came after a review of current approaches to estimate carbon-equivalent emissions. 

**Reproducibility:** The carbonr package seeks to provide a reliable and reproducible approach to calculating emissions levels, ensuring that the results can be saved, edited, and redistributed easily.

**Open Source:** R is an open-source language, which means that the carbonr package benefits from the collaborative nature of the R community. This allows for open discussions and contributions on platforms like GitHub, capturing different perspectives and enhancing the functionality of the package.

**Transparency and Flexibility:** The carbonr package aims for transparency to provide the ability to amend emissions values and tailor them to specific environments and contexts. This allows for greater flexibility and customisation in estimating emissions.

**Cost-effective:** The carbonr package being open source eliminates the need for users to incur additional costs. This makes it a cost-effective solution for estimating carbon-equivalent emissions.

**Accessibility:** The carbonr package aims to make the estimation of carbon-equivalent emissions more accessible by offering a user-friendly front-end interface using Shiny. This ensures that the tools are easier to use, even for individuals with limited programming experience.

**Expansion and Collaboration:** Although currently a small stand-alone package used within IDEMS International, the vision for carbonr is to expand and become more comprehensive. The creators invite contributions from the community to extend the package's functionality, build additional features, and transform it into a more robust tool for estimating carbon-equivalent emissions.

By addressing these challenges and incorporating these improvements, the carbonr package aims to provide a reliable, accessible, and customisable solution for estimating and offsetting carbon-equivalent emissions.

## Functions in CarbonR

carbonr is a package in R to conveniently calculate carbon-equivalent emissions. Currently, emission estimates relate to travel, materials, day-to-day, and clinically based.

* `airplane_emissions()`
* `ferry_emissions()`
* `rail_emissions()`
* `land_emissions()`
* `vehicle_emissions()`
* `hotel_emissions()`
* `building_emissions()`
* `office_emissions()`
* `household_emissions()`
* `construction_emissions()`
* `electrical_emissions()`
* `material_emissions()`
* `metal_emissions()`
* `paper_emissions()`
* `plastic_emissions()`
* `raw_fuels()`
* `anaesthetic_emissions()`
* `clinical_emissions()`
* `clinical_theatre_data()`

These all return carbon-equivalent emissions in tonnes.

A shiny app is also available by `shiny_emissions()` to calculate carbon-equivalent emissions with a GUI.

## Usage

We give some small examples in using the functions in `carbonr()`

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(carbonr)
```

To calculate emissions for a flight between Vancouver and Toronto, we first want to find the name of the airports. We do this using the `airport_finder()` function:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
airport_finder(name = "Vancouver")
```
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
airport_finder(name = "Vancouver") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
airport_finder(name = "Toronto")
```
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
airport_finder(name = "Toronto") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Now we can find the overall emission value using the appropriate IATA code. These distances are calculated using the Haversine formula:
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
airplane_emissions("YVR", "YYZ")
```

A similar approach can be performed for ferry emissions. For example, to calculate emissions for a round trip ferry from Melbourne to New York, we first find the appropriate seaport code with the `seaport_finder()` function:
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
seaport_finder(country = "Australia", city = "Melbourne")
```
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
seaport_finder(country = "Australia", city = "Melbourne") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
seaport_finder(country = "US", city = "New York")
```
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
seaport_finder(country = "US", city = "New York") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Now we can find the overall emission value using the appropriate seaport code:
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ferry_emissions("POR", "BOY", round_trip = TRUE)
```

For the UK we can calculate emissions for a train journey. Like with `airplane_emissions()` and `ferry_emissions()`, the distances are calculated using the Haversine formula - this is calculated as the crow flies. As before, we first find the stations. As always, for a more accurate estimation we can include via points:

To calculate emissions for a train journey from Bristol Temple Meads to Edinburgh Waverley, via Birmingham New Street. We can use a data frame and `purrr::map()` to read through the data easier:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
multiple_ind <- tibble::tribble(~ID, ~station,
                        "From", "Bristol",
                        "To", "Edinburgh",
                        "Via", "Birmingham")
purrr::map(.x = multiple_ind$station, .f = ~rail_finder(.x)) %>%
  dplyr::bind_rows()
```
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
multiple_ind <- tibble::tribble(~ID, ~station,
                        "From", "Bristol",
                        "To", "Edinburgh",
                        "Via", "Birmingham")
purrr::map(.x = multiple_ind$station, .f = ~rail_finder(.x)) %>%
  dplyr::bind_rows() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Then we can estimate the overall tCO2e emissions for the journey:
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
rail_emissions(from = "Bristol Temple Meads", to = "Edinburgh", via = "Birmingham New Street")
```

We can use a data frame to read through the data easier in general. For example, if we had data for multiple individuals, or journeys:
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
multiple_ind <- tibble::tribble(~ID, ~rail_from, ~rail_to, ~air_from, ~air_to, ~air_via,
                        "Clint", "Bristol Temple Meads", "Paddington", "LHR", "KIS", "NBO",
                        "Zara", "Bristol Temple Meads", "Paddington", "LHR", "LAX", "ORL")
multiple_ind %>%
  dplyr::rowwise() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(plane_emissions = airplane_emissions(air_from,
                                              air_to,
                                              air_via)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(train_emissions = rail_emissions(rail_from,
                                          rail_to)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(total_emissions = plane_emissions + train_emissions)
```
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
multiple_ind <- tibble::tribble(~ID, ~rail_from, ~rail_to, ~air_from, ~air_to, ~air_via,
                        "Clint", "Bristol Temple Meads", "Paddington", "LHR", "KIS", "NBO",
                        "Zara", "Bristol Temple Meads", "Paddington", "LHR", "LAX", "ORL")
multiple_ind %>%
  dplyr::rowwise() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(plane_emissions = airplane_emissions(air_from,
                                              air_to,
                                              air_via)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(train_emissions = rail_emissions(rail_from,
                                          rail_to)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(total_emissions = plane_emissions + train_emissions) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Additional emissions can be calculated as well. For example, office emissions
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
office_emissions(specify = TRUE, electricity_kWh = 255.2, water_supply = 85, heat_kWh = 8764)
```

Alternatively, more advance emissions can be given with other functions, such as the `material_emissions()`, `construction_emissions()`, and `raw_fuels()` functions.

## Shiny App

An interactive calculator using Shiny can be accessed by the `shiny_emissions()` function. This calculator uses some of the functions in the `carbonr` package: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
shiny_emissions()
```

## For the future
To calculate office emissions, we want the ability for the function to read in data from the office, perhaps accounting data. While the R side of this is relatively straightforward, this is on hold while we look to have an appropriate data set in place.

We intend to build in reports that give information on the users estimated emissions. This would include summary statistics, tables, and graphs.
