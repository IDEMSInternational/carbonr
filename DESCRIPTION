Description: Provides a flexible tool for calculating carbon-equivalent emissions. Mostly using data from the UK Government's Greenhouse Gas Conversion Factors report <https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2024>, it facilitates transparent emissions calculations for various sectors, including travel, accommodation, and clinical activities. The package is designed for easy integration into R workflows, with additional support for 'shiny' applications and community-driven extensions.
