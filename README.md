## Overview

`carbonr` is an R package designed to conveniently calculate
carbon-equivalent emissions using data from the [UK Government report
(2023)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2023).

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IDEMSInternational/carbonr")
```

## Aims of carbonr

`carbonr` was developed to provide a reliable and reproducible method
for calculating carbon-equivalent emissions. It aims to: - Ensure
transparency and flexibility in emissions calculations. - Facilitate
easy saving, editing, and redistribution of results. - Encourage
community contributions to extend functionality. - Provide a
user-friendly interface through Shiny for users with limited programming
experience.

## Functions in `carbonr`

Currently, the package includes functions for estimating emissions from
various sources:

### Travel-Related Emissions

- `airplane_emissions()`
- `ferry_emissions()`
- `rail_emissions()`
- `land_emissions()`
- `vehicle_emissions()`

### Accommodation-Related Emissions

- `hotel_emissions()`
- `building_emissions()`
- `office_emissions()`
- `household_emissions()`

### Material-Related Emissions

- `construction_emissions()`
- `electrical_emissions()`
- `material_emissions()`
- `metal_emissions()`
- `paper_emissions()`
- `plastic_emissions()`
- `raw_fuels()`

### Clinical Emissions

- `anaesthetic_emissions()`
- `clinical_emissions()`
- `clinical_theatre_data()`

All functions return carbon-equivalent emissions in tonnes. A Shiny app
is available via `shiny_emissions()` for a GUI-based calculation.

## Usage

Below are examples demonstrating how to use the `carbonr` package
functions:

``` r
library(carbonr)
```

### Example 1: Calculating Airplane Emissions

Find the IATA codes for Vancouver and Toronto:

``` r
airport_finder(name = "Vancouver")
```

| Name                                  | City      | Country | IATA |
|:--------------------------------------|:----------|:--------|:-----|
| Vancouver International Airport       | Vancouver | Canada  | YVR  |
| Vancouver Harbour Water Aerodrome     | Vancouver | Canada  | CXH  |
| Vancouver International Seaplane Base | Vancouver | Canada  |      |

``` r
airport_finder(name = "Toronto")
```

| Name                                     | City    | Country | IATA |
|:-----------------------------------------|:--------|:--------|:-----|
| Billy Bishop Toronto City Centre Airport | Toronto | Canada  | YTZ  |
| Toronto/Oshawa Executive Airport         | Oshawa  | Canada  | YOO  |

Calculate emissions for a flight between these cities:

``` r
airplane_emissions("YVR", "YTZ")
#> [1] 0.9876006
```

### Example 2: Emissions for Multiple Individuals

Create a data frame for multiple journeys:

``` r
multiple_ind <- tibble::tribble(~ID, ~rail_from, ~rail_to, ~air_from, ~air_to, ~air_via,
                        "Clint", "Bristol Temple Meads", "Paddington", "LHR", "KIS", "NBO",
                        "Zara", "Bristol Temple Meads", "Paddington", "LHR", "LAX", "ORL")
multiple_ind %>%
  dplyr::rowwise() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(plane_emissions = airplane_emissions(air_from,
                                              air_to,
                                              air_via)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(train_emissions = rail_emissions(rail_from,
                                          rail_to)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(total_emissions = plane_emissions + train_emissions)
```

| ID    | rail_from            | rail_to    | air_from | air_to | air_via | plane_emissions | train_emissions | total_emissions |
|:------|:---------------------|:-----------|:---------|:-------|:--------|----------------:|----------------:|----------------:|
| Clint | Bristol Temple Meads | Paddington | LHR      | KIS    | NBO     |        2.090193 |       0.0074051 |        2.097598 |
| Zara  | Bristol Temple Meads | Paddington | LHR      | LAX    | ORL     |        3.085740 |       0.0074051 |        3.093146 |

### Example 3: Office Emissions

Calculate emissions for office usage:

``` r
office_emissions(specify = TRUE, electricity_kWh = 255.2, water_supply = 85, heat_kWh = 8764)
#> [1] 0.002345161
```

## Beyond the Emissions Available in the 2023 UK Report

Additional functions are available for emissions not covered in the UK
Government report, such as those related to operating theatre waste.
Further details on using the operating theatre waste functions are
provided in the vignette.

### Carbon Credit Prices

The `carbon_credit_price()` function provides values based on [World
Bank data](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/).

## Shiny App

An interactive calculator using Shiny can be accessed by the
`shiny_emissions()` function. This calculator uses some of the functions
in the `carbonr` package:

``` r
shiny_emissions()
```

## For the Future

Planned features include: - Data integration for office emissions from
accounting records. - Comprehensive reporting tools with summary
statistics, tables, and graphs.
